## About
Past data analytic and Machine Learning projects 

Hi, I'm James! I have an analytical background in Biology and Food Science. I am currently on track to completing my Master in Business Analytics (MS. BA). I have developed a strong foundation in the life sciences and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data analyst. 

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and collaborate through cross functional teams. I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data analyst. 

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.
